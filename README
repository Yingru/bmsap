A data processing code to process the experimental observable from heavy-ion collision, generally deal with OSCAR format file.

Extract flag_wt option into sample.in file
Add infomation of the weight table into sample.in file

###############################################################################

flag_wt: 0 -- no weight; 1 -- weight is already included as the last parameter of the particle list
         2 -- the last parameter of the particle list is the length of the uniform distribution of pT_init
For flag_wt, one needs to read in the weight table (subroutine read_wt_table in readwt.f)
One may specify the name of the input file with "ftn10=filename". Otherwise, the default file name for the weight table is pT*_wt.dat
 
export ftn09=sample.in
export ftn10=pT*_wt.dat
cat filename (of particle list) | ./bms_ap.Linux

Output file is "bms_ap.13"
